Tiddlywiki 5 can be used to generate static HTML representations of a Tiddlywiki that doesn't need ~JavaScript. This process requires that Tiddlywiki be installed on Node.js on your local system. See [[Installing Tiddlywiki on Node.js|https://tiddlywiki.com/#Installing%20TiddlyWiki%20on%20Node.js]] for details.

There is much flexibility in how the static HTML is generated. The following scenarios are all illustrated on https://tiddlywiki.com.
